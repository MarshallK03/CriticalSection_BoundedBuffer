# CriticalSection_BoundedBuffer
These .py files implement a solution to both the critical section and bounded buffer problems via the implementation of Semaphores.

this program will run as long as all 4 .py files are placed into the same directory, however they require no further external dependencies and will run on any PC with python configured.
